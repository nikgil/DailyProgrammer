Laptop broke so couldn't code. So instead here is what I did to fix my issue. This was the solution that I used when I
realised the default online ones were not helping for various reasons. Also I DID NOT want to pay $70 for someone to
re-install Win10 and let me lose all my non-backed up data. This is a personal FU to the same person who said my laptop
was beyond saving

Steps to fix "windows could not complete the installation" on win10:
1. Turn off laptop
2. Take out battery & cord
3. Try to boot it a number of times to get all power out of motherboard
4. Plug in cord and start up
5. You should see a blue screen with fix options
    5a. If this fails, repeat step 2+3 and start up laptop while holding f8 key
6. Go into advanced options
7. Choose either to choose "System Restore" or what I did "Revert to previous version"

=== From here I will only focus on the latter, which is found by clicking more options in the advanced options menu ===
8. If you have an account with password enter that password
    8a. If you're an idiot like me and forgot their password then
    8b. go into command prompt and create a new admin user (can lookup how to do this on google pretty easily)
    8c. Once that is created you can use that account to revert to former build
9. It will give you some options to go back, just continue
10. Wait and profit
